### *A line following robot powered by a PIC18F8722 microcontroller*

This project forms part of a second year 'Embedded Systems Project' (ESP) group project with the aim to design, build and test a line-following robot. The robot must complete the track in the fastest time possible, and is capable of detecting a wall/end of line at either end of the track.

**This code is presented here as-is.**
